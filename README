Epidemia is a program to simulate an epidemic, exploring realistic infection processes. It
is licensed under GPLv3.

It is written in Python3.8, and also requires a few non-default packages: numpy, matplotlib and
TkInter.

To run it from the command line:

python3.8 edpidemia.py [-p population] [-i infectiousness] -P

will run for the specified population (in the range 10000-1000000) and infectiousness (default is 2.5,
anything in the range 1.5-4 should produce interesting results). It will show what is going on day by
day and when it has finished it will plot a graph (thanks to -P).

Many more options to control how it runs are described in the documentation.

Installation
------------

First clone or copy the files from github to some suitable directory. Then cd to the directory.

Now you will need python3.8, a Python virtual environment for it, and all the needed packages. Do
the following while running as sudo.

apt install python3.8
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib
apt install python3-tk

Once you've done this, the above command line will run epidemia.

Documentation

Documentation is a work in progress. It is at doc/epidemia.html.
