    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Epidemia simulates the large scale spread of a pandemic. It simulates
      each individual in the population, up to a limit of tens of millions, with
      realistic membership of family, workplace, friends and other groupings.All
      aspects of the interaction between individuals and society is controlled
      by parameters which can be modified for each run, or changed during a run
      to show the effect of varying them.</p>
    <p>It produces graphs showing the number of current and total infected
      people over time. It can also show the animated growth of infection
      city-by-city. It can also produce tabular data for analysis by other
      means.</p>
    <h1><a name="installation" id="installation">Installation</h1>
    <p>The code for Epidemia can be obtained from github: <a href="https://github.com/harper493/epidemia">https://github.com/harper493/epidemia</a>.
      The code is written in Python (specifically the 3.8 dialect) and in C++.
      It has a few external dependencies. The C++ code will need to be built for
      your system.A Makefile for Ubuntu and other Linux variants is part of the
      distro.</p>
    <p>The following commands, on Ubuntu, will install and build all the
      necessary components.</p>
    <p class="code"> apt install python3.8<br>
      apt install libboost-dev-all<br>
      apt-get install python3.8-venv<br>
      python3.8 -m venv .venv<br>
      source .venv/bin/activate<br>
      pip3 install numpy<br>
      pip3 install matplotlib<br>
      apt install python3-tk<br>
      cd cpp<br>
      make</p>
    <p> For other systems (Mac, Windows) you will need to figure out how to
      build it in the equivalent way. (If you do, please also contribute it to
      github).</p>
    <h1>Running Epidemia</h1>
    <p>Once in the Python virtual environment, the following command:</p>
    <p class="code">python3.8 epidemia.py -p <em>population</em> -i <em>infectiousness</em>
      -P</p>
    <p> will run for the specified population (in the range 10000-10000000) and
      infectiousness (the default is 2.5, anything in the range 1.5-4 should
      produce interesting results). It will show what is going on day by day on
      a graph.</p>
    <p>The simulation itself is done by the C++ code, which is run automatically
      from the Python code as needed.</p>
    <p>There are four ways Epidemia can be run:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to produce a simple graph, as above</li>
      <li>to produce tabular data: replace -P with -o followed by the file where
        the tabular data should be created.</li>
      <li>to produce multiple graphs on the same axes, varying one or more
        parameters. This is described in detail below, under "Sensitivity
        Analysis".</li>
      <li>to produce a"bubble" animation showing the development of the pandemic
        in multiple cities. Replace -P with -B.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="options" id="options">Command Line Options</h2>
    <p>Command line options, as described below, can be used to set the way the
      simulation runs, and to control its output. There are many simulation
      parameters which do not have their own command line options. Thesecan be
      set as described at the end of this section. </p>
    <p>The following command line options are available.</p>

    <p>To set simulation parameters which do not have their own command line
      options, two methods are available. First, they can be specified at the
      end of the command line using one or more '<em>name</em>=<em>value</em>'
      constructs. For example: </p>
    <p class="code">python3.8 epidemia.py -p 1000000 -i 2.5 -P mobility_max=0.3
      mobility_average=0.002 </p>
    <p>Alternatively, multiple parameter settings may be combined into a <em>properties
        file</em>, whose name is appended to the command line. For example: </p>
    <p class="code">python3.8 epidemia.py -p 1000000 -i 2.5 -P
      my_parameters.props </p>
    <p>The properties file format is described in a later section. </p>
    <h2><a name="sensitivity" id="sensitivity">Sensitivity Analysis</h2>
    <p>Often it is interesting to see how changing a parameter affects the
      evolution of the pandemic. This can be done using the -S command line
      option. It is followed by the name of a parameter, and the values to use.
      These can either be in a comma-separated list, or in the form <em>initial-value:increment:final-value</em>.
      For example:</p>
    <p class="code">-S infectiousness:1:0.5:3<br>
      -S infectiousness:0.8,1,1,2,1.5,2,2,5,3</p>
    <p>It is possible to vary two or more parameters in parallel, separating the
      two with ';'. For example:</p>
    <p class="code">-S xxx:1,2,3;yyy:10,11,12</p>
    <p>This will run three times, once with xxx=1 and yyy=10, then with
      xxx=2,yyy=11 and finally with xxx=3,yyy=12.</p>
    <p>It is also possible to run combinations of parameter values, separating
      them with '+'. For example:</p>
    <p class="code">-S xxx:1:0.5:3+yyy:0.2,0.5</p>
    <p>will run first with xxx=1 and yyy taking each of 0.2 and 0.5, then again
      with xxx=1.5 and yyy=0.2 and then 0.5, and so on.</p>
    <p>The increment can be replaced by a multiplier, using '*'. For example:</p>
    <p class="code">-S xxx:0.1*2:0.8</p>
    <p>will run with xxx taking the values 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>How The Simulation Works</h1>
    <p>To understand the parameters that control the simulation and how they can
      be adjusted, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of how the
      simulation operates.</p>
    <h2><a name="infection_probability" id="infection_probability"></a>Infection
      Probability</h2>
    <p>While it's common to use the term <em>R0</em> to describe the
      infectiousness of a disease, this is actually a description of its effect
      - how rapidly it spreads. To build a model, we need something at a much
      lower level that can be used in a simulation. We call this the <em>infection
        probability</em>. It is the probability that a single susceptible
      person, exposed to a single infected person for one day, will themselves
      be infected, or develop an immune response. </p>
    <p>For Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses, we know that this is a bit of
      an oversimplification. A single cough or sneeze can infect someone, or
      spending less than an hour close to an infected person, especially if they
      are exhaling heavily, for example while singing. Still, it captures the
      fact that such an event is itself probabilistic. </p>
    <p>To derive the infection probability, we work backwards from the desired
      infectiousness (R0). Knowing the average sizes of the clusters, and the
      period for which an infected person is infectious, we can get a first
      estimate. We then apply a empirical correction factor, based on measuring
      the actual observed R0 from the simulation. </p>
    <p>The numerical value of the infection probability is quite small. For an
      R0 of 2.5 with the default parameter settings in the model, it is about
      0.005. </p>
    <h2><a name="clusters" id="clusters"></a>Clusters</h2>
    <p>The key to this model is that everybody is a member of several groups, or
      clusters. Within a cluster, everyone is heavily exposed to everyone else.
      The default clusters are family, friends, work and (with lower intimacy)
      the local community. </p>
    <p>In the simulation of a single day, first the <em>exposure</em> of each
      cluster is calculated. This is simply the number of infectious members of
      the cluster, multiplied by the infection probability. Then, for each
      susceptible (not immune or infected) member of the cluster, this
      probability is used to decide whether or not they become infected. </p>
    <p>Clusters are organised in a hierarchy, so every first level cluster
      belongs to a second level cluster, and so on. When cluster exposure is
      being calculated, it is passed up the hierarchy, being diluted at each
      step by a factor called <em>nest_influence</em> (by default, 0.15). So
      one infected person in a first level cluster is equivalent to 0.15
      infected people in the second level cluster, and 0.0225 (0.15 squared) in
      its third level cluster. </p>
    <p>Once the exposure has been rolled up to the top of the cluster hierarchy,
      it is then pushed back down again to each of its members, again being
      multiplied by the value of <em>nest_influence</em>. So one sick person in
      a first level cluster ends up being equivalent to 0.0225 sick people in
      each of its peers. This doesn't sound much, but as infection levels rise,
      it's enough to spread the infection into different clusters. </p>
    <p>Some clusters, in particular family and workplace, represent a very close
      level of interaction. Others though represent something more distant. In
      particular, the <em>locale</em> cluster represents interactions with the
      local environment, such as shopping and public transport. The <em>influence</em>
      of a cluster represents the closeness of this interaction. Exactly as with
      <em>nest_influence</em>, the contribution of an infected person to a
      cluster, and the risk it brings to a susceptible person, are both
      multiplied by this influence factor. For the locale cluster, it is 0.2 by
      default. So for a susceptible person sharing a cluster with one infected
      person, their chance of infection is 0.04 (0.2 squared) what it wold be
      sharing a family or workplace with them. This makes sense because such
      clusters are a lot bigger; the default average size of a locale cluster is
      40 compared to 4 for a family or 8 for a workplace. </p>
    <p>Not all clusters apply to all individuals. For example, some people live
      on their own, and others are unemployed or work alone. This is reflected
      in the <em>singleton</em> cluster parameter, which is the proportion of
      people who do not belong to a first level cluster. </p>
    <p>Even within a category, not all clusters are the same size. For example,
      the average size of a family group is 4, but there are some larger
      families. Cluster sizes are chosen at random with a reciprocal-like
      distribution, i.e. smaller values are more common than larger values. The
      shape of the distribution is determined by three parameters: <em>min_pop</em>,
      the smallest cluster (by default, 2), <em>max_pop</em>, the largest
      cluster, and <em>average_pop</em>, the mean of all the cluster sizes.
      Similarly, the higher level clusters have a varying number of subsidiary
      clusters. </p>
    <h2><a name="cities" id="cities"></a>Cities</h2>
    <p>Every person belongs to a city. There are several cities - with a
      population of one million, by default there are about 40 cities. Just as
      with clusters, their size follows a reciprocal-like distribution, with a
      few large cities and many smaller ones. In the bubble view, each city is
      represented by a colored blob, its size in proportion to the population. </p>
    <p>Every cluster is associated with a city. Mostly, people are associated
      with clusters in their own city, and clusters belong to higher level
      clusters in their own city. There are exceptions though, expressed by the
      <em>same_city</em> parameter. This corresponds to someone who works in a
      different city, for example, or to a family whose relatives are all in a
      different city. This provides one means for infection to be passed to
      another city. </p>
    <p>When someone belongs to a cluster in a different city, the target city is
      chosen at random but weighted by population and distance. It is more
      likely that someone will be associated with somewhere that is nearby or
      has a large population, than somewhere which is distant and has a small
      population. </p>
    <p>The model assumes people travel between cities. Each person is assigned a
      <em>mobility</em> value, whose average by default is 0.001. This is the
      probability that on any given day, they will travel to another city. As
      with cluster membership, the choice of city is weighted by population and
      distance. If someone does travel, for that day they are treated exactly
      the same as a randomly chosen person in the city they are visiting, just
      as if they were spending the day with that person. </p>
    <p>Every city has a geographical <em>size</em>, in kilometers This is a
      function of the population, but it is not linear. Larger cities have a
      higher density, and hence are smaller in proportion to their size. This
      affects the influence of the locale cluster. It is also used to size the
      "blobs" on the bubbles display.</p>
    <h2><a name="distance" id="distance">Social Distance</h2>
    <p>A common question in the current pandemic is the value of social
      distancing. How thorough does it have to be to have significant effect?
      Does it have any effect at all? The model has a <em>distance</em>
      parameter, whose value lies between 0 and 1. Zero means "business as
      usual"; all the parameters take their default values. It can be set on the
      command line using the -d option. </p>
    <p>A distancing value of one corresponds to the highest degree of distancing
      possible while society still functions, for example that people have
      enough to eat and urgent medical conditions are attended to. This is what
      was implemented in Wuhan or Spain during the outbreak. </p>
    <p>The primary implementation of distancing is through the level of contact
      within clusters. People remain fully in contact with their families, so
      this does not change. Wit full distancing, contact between friends drops
      to zero, so the influence value for the friends cluster is zero. Some
      people have to continue to work, so the average influence value for the
      work cluster is taken as 20% of its normal value. </p>
    <p>For values of distance between 0 and 1, affected parameters take the
      corresponding pro-rata values. For example, if distance is 0.5, then the
      work cluster influence is 0.6, i.e. half way between 1 and 0.2. </p>
    <h2><a name="auto_immunity" id="auto_immunity">Auto Immunity</h2>
    <p>With any disease, some people are exposed but show no signs of infection.
      In some cases they may be asymptomatic but infectious. In other cases,
      their immune systems may react quickly enough that they gain immunity
      without ever becoming infectious. </p>
    <p>This is reflected by the parameter <em>auto_immunity</em>, settable from
      the command line using the -a option. It takes a value between 0, meaning
      that nobody becomes immune without becoming infectious, and 1, which would
      mean nobody becomes infectious (so there would be no pandemic). </p>
    <p>It should be noted that for Covd-19, this value is unknown. It is certain
      that some people are exposed but never develop symptoms - about 50%, in
      general. But it is not known what proportion of those, if any, never
      become infectious. </p>
    <h2><a name="vaccination" id="vaccination">Vaccination</h2>
    <p>People who are vaccinated against a disease will never become infectious,
      or symptomatic, even if they are exposed. The parameter <em>vaccination</em>
      expresses the proportion of people who are effectively vaccinated, taking
      a value between 0 and 1. It can be set from the command line using the -v
      option. </p>
    <p>In reality, vaccination is not always effective. In a recent annual
      influenza pandemic, the effectiveness of that year's vaccine was estimated
      at 25%. The value of the option is given as the product of uptake and
      effectiveness. For example, if 60% of people get vaccinated, and the
      vaccine is 50% effective, then the vaccination parameter should be set to
      0.3. </p>
    <h2><a name="transition_times" id="transition_times">Transition Times (Gestation, Recovery)</h2>
    <p>Sometimes the transition of a person from one state to another depends on
      time. When a person is infected, they go through a period where they are
      not yet infectious, but cannot be re-infected - the <em>gestation</em>
      state. When someone becomes infectious, they will recover or die after a
      certain time. These times are parameters of the model, called for example
      <em>recovery_time</em> and <em>recovery_sd</em>. When a person enters
      such a state, their transition time is chosen at random using a log-normal
      distribution with the given parameters. </p>
    <h1>Model Parameters</h1>
    <h2>Properties Files</h2>
    <p>The model's operation is controlled by a large number of parameters. A
      few of these can be controlled by their own command line options, such as
      distance and population. All the others can be specified on the command
      line, using the "<em>name</em>=<em>value</em>" syntax, and varied using
      the susceptibility (-S) option. </p>
    <p>It is also possible to create a properties file, containing values of
      several parameters. This is in the standard Java properties file format,
      consisting of one or more lines of the form "<em>name</em>=<em>value</em>".
      Comments can be included in the file, either on a line by themselves or at
      the end of a value specification, introduced by "#". For an example, see
      the file <em>base.props</em>, which contains the default values of all
      parameters. </p>
    <p>Parameter names have a structure, consisting of name parts separated by
      ".". Some have just a single name, such as "population" and "city_count".
      Others have a more elaborate structure. For example all parameters
      relating to clusters are named as "cluster.<em>cluster-type</em>.<em>parameter</em>",
      for example "cluster.family.average_pop". </p>
    <p>In a properties file, one or more of the name parts can be replaced by
      "*". In that case the value given applies to all matching names, unless
      overridden by something more explicit. For example, the value given for
      "cluster.*.influence" applies to all clusters that do not specify their
      own value, such as "cluster.locale.influence". </p>
